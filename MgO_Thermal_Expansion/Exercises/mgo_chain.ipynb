It should not be modified, all the control options (**k** point and supercell creation) are in the subsequent cells. Even if the cell should not be modified, every line has been commented in order for the student to understand what the code is doing. The output of the first code cell is the phonon dispersion for the MgO chain. (If you cannot see it, run the cell again).\n",

    "The MgO chain is only periodic along the $x$ direction. Systems with dimentsionality lower than three can still be simulated by using a 3D periodic cell with the inclusion of a vacuum region. For example, in the following exercise, the MgO chain is simulated through a cell whose length along the x direction is the optimised distance between atoms in the chain and has a 10 Angrstrom length along the other two directions. This means that the replicas of the chain will be far enough to ensure there is no interaction among them. \n",
